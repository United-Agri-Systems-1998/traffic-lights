Test Scenario

Testing scenario:
Traffic Light Program on Beckhoff Platform
	• Objective: Create a traffic light control program using Beckhoff TwinCAT 3.
	• Requirements:
		○ The program should control 2 sets of traffic lights (4 total) with three states: Red, Yellow, and Green.
		○ Each light should follow a standard traffic light sequence.
		○ Implement 1 pedestrian crossing button that changes the light sequence to allow safe crossing for one direction only, after a 15 second crossing time the lights should return to the previous orientation.
	• Evaluation Criteria:
		○ Code quality and readability.
		○ Correctness of the traffic light sequence.
		○ Handling of edge cases (e.g., simultaneous pedestrian button presses).
		○ Ability to explain the code and logic during a brief presentation.
	• Timeline (estimates)
		○ Basic PLC code for traffic light function (2 hours)
		○ Basic HMI design for lights and buttons (2 hours)
		○ Testing and troubleshooting (2 hours)
	• Resources
    		○ Use the provided VM with Beckhoff installed (We will provide)
